# Multi-Container-Application-Deployment with Docker Compose and Kubernetes

## 1. Overview

This document explains the architecture, deployment strategy, and step-by-step instructions for building, deploying, and managing a multi-container application consisting of three services:

* Frontend: React application

* Backend: Node.js API

* Database: MongoDB Compass

The deployment is managed using Docker Compose for local development. The application demonstrates container orchestration, container networking, and dependency management across services.

## 2. Architecture

Application Components:

1. Frontend: Github Repo  ``` https://github.com/Anand-1432/Techdome-frontend ```
* React application, served via port 3000.

2. Backend: Githib Repo ```https://github.com/Anand-1432/Techdome-backend```
* Backend with Node.js, exposed on port 5000.
* Serves the API to interact with the database.
* Uses PostgreSQL as its database.

3. Database:
* MongoDB database, running on port 27017.
* Stores application data and is accessible by the backend.

## 3. Deployment Strategy
### Local Development: Docker Compose

For local development, we use Docker Compose to run all the containers on a single network, enabling communication between the frontend, backend, and database.

* Frontend connects to the backend API.
* Backend interacts with the database.

### Production: Kubernetes

In a production environment, the application is deployed to a Kubernetes cluster (Minikube) with services managed via Kubernetes deployment manifests.

## 4. Docker Compose Configuration
In the root directory of the project, create a docker-compose.yml file. This file will define the services for Frontend, Backend, and Database, and will ensure they are networked together.

### Directory Structure:
```bash
multi-container-app/
├── backend/
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── index.js
│   └── ...
├── frontend/
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   └── ...
├── docker-compose.yml
└── README.md
```


Here's docker-compose.yml file

```
version: '3'

services:
  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - backend
    networks:
      - app-network
  
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: mongodb://mongo:27017/mydatabase
    depends_on:
      - db
    networks:
      - app-network
  
  db:
    image: mongo:6
    environment:
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: root
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
      MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE: mydatabase
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    networks:
      - app-network
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "mongo", "--eval", "db.adminCommand('ping')"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 5

## 5. Building and Deploying

### Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repositories:

Clone both the frontend and backend repositories into the appropriate directories.

``` git clone https://github.com/Anand-1432/Techdome-frontend ```

``` git clone https://github.com/Anand-1432/Techdome-backend ```

### 2. Create a Dockerfile for each frontend as well as for backend here`s dockerfiles for each frontend and backend

Dockerfile for Frontend:
```
# Official node image 
FROM node:16-alpine

# working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install


# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Build the application
RUN yarn build

# Serve the application using a simple web server
RUN npm install -g serve
CMD ["serve", "-s", "build"]


# Expose the frontend port
EXPOSE 3000
```

Dockerfile for Backend:

```
#Official Node.js image
FROM node:16-alpine


# Working directory  
WORKDIR /app


# Copy the package.json and install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the backend application
COPY . .


# Start the application
CMD ["npm", "start"]

# Expose the backend port
EXPOSE 5000
```

Database Container (PostgreSQL):

* I used a pre-built PostgreSQL Docker image, which I defined in the docker-compose.yml file.

### 2. Build and Run Containers:

Run the following command to build and start all services using Docker Compose:

``` docker-compose up --build ```

This command will:

* Build the Docker images for the frontend and backend from their respective Dockerfiles.
* Start the MongoDB database.
* Run the containers on a single network.

  ### 3. Access the Application:

* Frontend: Visit ```http://localhost:3000``` in your browser to access the React frontend.
* Backend: Visit ```http://localhost:5000``` for the backend API.
* Database: The MongoDB database will run internally and is accessible via the backend.

### 4. Stopping the Application:
To stop all services, use:

```docker-compose down```

## 6. Kubernetes Deployment
